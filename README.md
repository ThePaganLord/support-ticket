This project is not finished. I am still learning Laravel and how to use the framework and I will continue to add to the project as I travel along my learning path.
Although I compare this to coding in straight PHP and know that I could produce the software in "that" environment, learning something new is as exhilarating as it is terrifiying and frustrating.
As I learn the frustruation lessens and my skills become stronger but right now, I'm still learning.
